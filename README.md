# ros_gripper

This project is to develop and improve upon a system that can read fiducial markers on an object and drive an arm to that position in a repeatable and tolerant proof way so that it may grab the object and release it else where.

Use for storage of any code that needs to be shared between the team members.

grab_demo is the final product

Other files are either demos or testing scripts.
